  of absolute rotation into relative orientation, which finds the transformation between
  two 2D systems. We cover the problem of binocular stereo and tessellations from
  solids, critical surfaces.

  youtube_description: 'In this lecture, we will transition from solving problems
    of absolute rotation (which, if you recall, finds the transformation between two
    3D coordinate systems) into relative orientation, which finds the transformation
    between two 2D coordinate systems. We will start by covering the problem of binocular
    stereo, and in the process talk about tessellations from solids,

    critical surfaces.'
